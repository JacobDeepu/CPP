Algorithm:

    Step 1: Start
    Step 2: Create class, with string data type member s1 and member functions to read and find length of string.
    Step 3: Length=0
    Step 4: Input string s1
    Step 5: Repeat step 6 while s1[length] not Null
    Step 6: length=length+1
    Step 7: Output length
    Step 8: Stop

Output:

    Enter the string: Jacob Deepu
    Length of string = 11
